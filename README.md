**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the Strava v1 and v2 APIs are **going away** on May 31 2013!

That unfortunately means that this library will stop working at that time, since
the API endpoints will be turned off. 

See http://engineering.strava.com/strava-api-update/ for the details.

I have requested developer access to the upcoming v3 API, but have not yet heard
back from Strava. Once I have access to the API, I will update this library to
support it.

It's unfortunate that Strava is choosing to disable the old APIs before the new
one is released, but there's not much to be done about it.
